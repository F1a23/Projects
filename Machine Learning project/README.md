# 🍽️ Sentiment Analysis of European Restaurant Reviews
### Machine Learning & NLP Project 🤖📊

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **sentiment analysis** of European restaurant reviews using  
**Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

The goal is to automatically classify customer reviews into:
- ✅ **Positive**
- ❌ **Negative**

The project was developed as a **team academic project**, emphasizing collaboration, experimentation, and model comparison.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze large volumes of restaurant reviews efficiently  
- Apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction  
- Compare multiple machine learning models  
- Identify the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics  

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Type:** European restaurant reviews  
- **Size:** ~1,500+ reviews  
- **Features:**  
  - Review text  
  - Sentiment label (Positive / Negative)

---

## 🧠 Models Used
We experimented with multiple machine learning models to compare performance:

- 🔹 **Naive Bayes**  
- 🔹 **Logistic Regression**  
- 🔹 **Gradient Boosting**

Text data was transformed using **TF-IDF** before model training.

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering
Additional features were created to improve model performance:
- Review length  
- Word count  
- Exclamation count  
- Positive & negative word counts  

---

## 📈 Model Performance
After evaluation and optimization:

🏆 **Best Model:** Logistic Regression  
🎯 **Best Accuracy:** **~97%**

Logistic Regression showed the most **stable and accurate performance** among all tested models.
