# 📂 Projects Portfolio

This folder contains a collection of projects that I worked on either individually or as part of a team.  
The projects reflect my journey in software engineering, data science, AI, and various technical areas I explored throughout university studies and personal development.

Each project is organized in its own folder with a dedicated "README.md" that explains the idea, purpose, and tools used.

This portfolio serves as a showcase of my practical experience, problem-solving abilities, and commitment to learning and building real-world solutions.
