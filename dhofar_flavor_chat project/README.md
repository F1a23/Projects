# Dhofar Flavor AI 🍽️🌿  
**Generative AI Chatbot for Traditional Dhofari Cuisine**

## 📌 Project Overview
**Dhofar Flavor AI** is a Generative AI–powered chatbot developed as the final project of the **Makeen Bootcamp**, completed prior to starting the on-the-job training phase.

The project focuses on preserving and promoting **traditional Dhofari cuisine** by providing accurate, structured, and reliable recipe information using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
